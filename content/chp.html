                <h2 class="topic__section__title" id="item-1">1. understand classes as building blocks of Java</h2>
                <h3 class="topic__section__subtitle">What are classes?</h3>
                <p>Let's kick off with a basic fact of Java: <q>Classes are the basic building blocks of Java</q>. That's nice, but what are classes in Java?</p>
                <p>If you have programming experience in another language, you probably have already learnt about objects and object constructors, and in Java, classes are basically the object constructors.
                    If you have not learnt about objects before, they are in a sense like what we call objects in real life. Just as an object in reality has some describable attributes and functions, so do objects in Java.
                    In light of that, a Java class is like a blueprint for creating objects in Java. For example,
                    you may want to create multiple student objects in Java to represent a group of students in the real world.
                    To do that, you would first create a <span class="emphasis">Student</span> class, and then use that class to create the student objects you need.</p>
                <p>Note that a class in Java always starts with a capital letter. That's why in the above we have a "<span class="emphasis">Student</span>" class, instead of
                    a "student" class. When it comes to other things in Java, they typically start with a lowercase letter so as to differentiate themselves from the classes.</p>

                <h3 class="topic__section__subtitle">Members of a class: Fields &amp; Methods</h3>
                <p>Let's start with fields. A <span class="keyword">field</span> is a variable inside a class. For example, a <span class="emphasis">Student</span> class may include the following fields as attributes:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>name</li>
                    <li>grade</li>
                    <li>school</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These fields are set up so that for each student object we create, we can have different values assigned to them. For example, if we make a object student_A out of the Student class,
                    we can have personal data about the student stored in the object which would help us do things with it later. When it comes to doing things with an object,
                    we are talking about their methods. A <span class="keyword">method</span> is a block of code in that would be executed when you call it.
                    For example, a Student class may provide one method to display the name, grade and school data of a student object, and another method to set/update those data:
                </p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    class Student { <span class="comment">// declaring a Student class</span><br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;private String name; <span class="comment">// setting up (declaring) the fields</span><br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;private int grade;<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;private String school;<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;public void printStudentInfo() <span class="comment">// set up a method to display the information</span>{<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Name: " + name + "; Grade: " + grade + "; School: " + school); <span class="comment">// System.out.println() is how to print a line to the console</span><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;public void setStudentInfo(String given_name, int given_grade, String given_school) <span class="comment">// set up a method to set the information of a student</span><br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name = given_name;<br />
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade = given_grade;<br />
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school = given_school;<br />
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
                    }
                </code>
                <p>If you are new to Java, you would probably find the above hard to grasp at first. Don't worry, the main take-away here is the concepts of fields and methods.
                    As for the code, we will delve into the details and see more examples later.
                </p>
                <p>Having said that, with regards to methods, it would be beneficial to get familiar with the basic syntax of it right away:</p>
                <img class="topic__section__example" src="../src/examples/chp_example_1.png" alt="method declaration example">
                <p>As shown in the above, <span class="specialName">setStudentInfo</span> is the <span class="emphasis">method name</span> by which we can call the method, and the parentheses following it include the <span class="emphasis">method parameter list</span>.
                    As we have seen with the <span class="specialName">printStudentInfo</span> method though, the method parameter list can be empty (therefore taking no argument), but the parentheses must still be there.</p>
                <p>We will cover methods in greater details later. For now, just keep in mind that a method has a method name and method parameter list, and these two combined are commonly referred to as the <span class="keyword">method signature</span>.</p>

            <section class="topic__section">
                <h2 class="topic__section__title" id="item-2">2. learn different ways to write comments inside a Java program</h2>
                <p>We have seen some <span class="keyword">comments</span> already. In the above, the <span class="comment">//</span> (double forward slash) is used to indicate the start of a comment until the end of line (i.e. everything starting from <span class="comment">//</span> on that line gets ignored).
                    Comments are helpful in helping other programmers understand what you are coding. They are generally a good practice, and are highly appreciated for some more complex logic that would not be readily consumed without some explanations.</p>
                <p>Besides <span class="comment">//</span>, another way to write comments in Java is with <span class="comment">/* everything in between will get ignored */</span>. This is helpful when writing multi-line comments. For example:</p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    <span class="emphasis">/*</span> &lt;-- Start of the comment<br />
                    You may write anything in between<br />
                    Include whatever information that you think is necessary<br />
                    So that the program gets easier for others and yourself to read<br/>
                    End of the comment --&gt; <span class="emphasis">*/</span>
                </code>
                <p>There is actually a third way to write comments in Java, but it is specifically made for Javadoc.
                    As stated in <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc" target="_blank">this Wikipedia entry</a>, <q>Javadoc is a documentation generator [...] for the Java language for generating API documentation in HTML format from Java source code.</q>
                    We will not talk about Javadoc in details in this set of notes, but feel free to learn more about it on <a class="external" href="https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html" target="_blank">this official Oracle entry</a>.
                    To write comments for Javadoc, simply start with <span class="emphasis">/**</span> (yes, two asterisks here) and end with <span class="emphasis">*/</span> (similar to the previous one, this can span multiple lines).
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="topic__section">
                <h2 class="topic__section__title" id="item-3">3. learn the basics of a main() method</h2>
                <p>Here is another important fact of Java: <q>A Java program begins execution with its <span class="emphasis">main()</span> method.</q> In other words,
                    the main() method is the bread and butter of a Java program as without it, Java programs would not know where to start. Below is how you would write a
                    main() method:</p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    public class Game {<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="emphasis">public static void main(</span>String[] args<span class="emphasis">){</span><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">// do something or nothing</span><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="emphasis">}</span><br />
                        }
                </code>
                <p>A main() method always has the modifiers <span class="emphasis">public</span>, <span class="emphasis">staic</span>, the return type <span class="emphasis">void</span> and surely the method name <span class="emphasis">main</span>.
                    We will talk more about modifiers and return types in <a href="ch3.html" class="nav__link">Topic 3: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts</a>. For now, it suffices to know that these are required when writing the main() method.</p>
                <p>As for the <span class="specialName">String[] args</span> which is the only method parameter, it is actually a String array which takes in any number of String(s) you provide. This explains why when we run a Java program from the command line,
                    we can provide some arguments as they are taken as strings by the program's main() method. Let's have a look at an example below to make sure you hammer this notion home.</p>
                <p>Consider the following silly java file:</p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    public class Hello {<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;public staic void main(String[] arguments) { <span class="comment">// it is not a must to call it args, you can call the parameters whatever you want</span><br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (String argument: arguments) { <span class="comment">// a for loop to loop through the arguments (covered later)</span><br />
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Hello " + argument + "!"); <span class="comment">// print out Hello and the argument as a line for every argument given</span><br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
                    }
                </code>
                <p>Let's say we have compiled this java file to a class and now run the class in a terminal with the following command:</p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    java Hello robots mice pizzas "cats and dogs"
                </code>
                <p>Then we will get back 4 separate lines of output in the terminal:</p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    Hello robots!<br />
                    Hello mice!<br />
                    Hello pizzas!<br />
                    Hello cats and dogs! <span class="comment">// Note how quotation marks can group words into a single argument</span>
                </code>
                <p>Surely, the main() method can do a bunch of other things with the arguments other than printing them out, but
                    the idea here is just to showcase the basic usage of the main() method, and why it has the parameter <span class="specialName">String[] args</span>.
                </p>
                <p>One last note here, besides writing the parameter as <span class="specialName">String[] args</span>, we can also write it as <span class="specialName">String args[]</span> which is simply another accepted way to denote a String array in Java.
                    We will learn more about these ways of declaring an array later. Also, we can write the parameter as <span class="emphasis">varargs</span> like this: <span class="specialName">String... args</span>. Varargs are an arbitrary number of arguments,
                    which in the case of a main() method, is another suitable parameter for taking whatever number of arguments.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="topic__section">
                <h2 class="topic__section__title" id="item-4">4. learn about imports</h2>
                <p>Before we can understand imports in Java properly, we must first learn about what packages are. In short, a <span class="keyword">package</span> is where related classes are placed together.
                    There are two types of packages: (1) Java built-in packages &amp; (2) your own packages. In this section, we will focus on how to import built-in packages in Java such as the <span class="emphasis">Java.util</span> package which
                    contains a lot of useful classes such as the <span class="emphasis">ArrayList</span> class which we would have a closer look in a later topic. To import the ArrayList class from the Java.util package so that we can use it in our program,
                    we just need to write an import statement like below:</p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    import Java.util.ArrayList; <span class="comment">// the import statement has to be placed before the class</span><br />
<br />
                    public class Demo {<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String... args) {<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ArrayList someArrayList = new ArrayList(); <span class="comment">// create an empty ArrayList</span><br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;someArrayList.add(1);<span class="comment">// add Integer 1 to the ArrayList</span><br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(someArrayList); <span class="comment">// print [1]</span><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
                    }
                </code>
                <p>In Java, we have something called a wildcard, denoted by <span class="emphasis">*</span>, which can be used to mean "everything".
                    So let's say we don't only want to import the ArrayList class from the Java.util, but also other classes from the same package.
                    Then, what we can do is to write the import statement: <span class="formula">import Java.util.*</span> instead.</p>
                <p>In general, we would like to create packages for our own code as well. To do so, we need to write a package statement at the very top
                    of our program, before any import statements and classes. For example, let's say we actually want the above demo class to reside in
                    a package called "code_examples":
                </p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    <span class="comment">//Of course I can still put some comments here which will simply be ignored</span><br />
                    package code_examples; <span class="comment">// the package statement has to be placed before any import statements and classes</span><br />

                <p>Without defining your own packages, when you work with other classes from Java itself and other programmers, you may easily have classes with the same names
                    which will cause the issue of <span class="emphasis">name conflicts</span>. Defining packages makes it easier to work with code of others as even if you may have
                    classes with the same names, their <span class="keyword">fully qualified names</span> are likely different. In fact, packages are imperative in Java that if you
                    do not state what packages your own classes are in, when they are compiled, the resulting class files will still have a package name: <span class="emphasis">.</span> (dot),
                    which is also know as the <span class="emphasis">default package</span>.
                </p>
                <p>Let's consider the situation when we run to conflicting class names from two different packages that we want to import into a single file.
                    What should we do? For example, there is a Date class from the java.util package and also a Date class from the java.sql package.
                    One thing for sure is we cannot do the following:
                </p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    import Java.util.*;<br />
                    import Java.sql.*; <span class="comment">// it is fine here as we have not used the Date class</span><br />
<br />
                    public class Ambiguous {<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String... args) {<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date date; <span class="comment">// <span class="emphasis">DNC (Does not compile)</span> as the Date class is ambiguous here</span><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
                    }<br />
                </code>
                <p>The above code will fail to compile because Java cannot decide which Date class do we mean to use (Java.sql.Date or Java.util.Date?)
                    The same is true if we replace <span class="formula">import Java.util.*</span> and <span class="formula">import Java.sql.*</span> with
                    <span class="formula">import Java.util.Date</span> and <span class="formula">import Java.sql.Date</span> as this does not solve the ambiguity problem.
                    However, if we only change either one of them, for example, <span class="formula">import Java.util.*</span> to <span class="formula">import Java.util.Date</span>,
                    then the code will compile because we explicitly want Java.util.Date rather than Java.sql.Date:
                </p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    import Java.util.Date; <span class="comment">// explicitly want the Date class</span><br />
                    import Java.sql.*; <span class="comment">// although it still imports the Date class, it is sort of implied </span><br />
<br />
                    public class NoLongerAmbiguous {<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String... args) {<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date date; <span class="comment">// it is okay now and uses the Java.util.Date class</span><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
                    }<br />
                </code>
                <p>How about if we still want to have other classes from the <span class="specialName">Java.util</span> package? Well, in that case,
                    we can still write the <span class="formula">import Java.util.*</span> statement in addition to <span class="formula">import Java.util.Date</span>.
                    This is okay because Java accepts redundant import statments.</p>
                <p>Another way to work around this problem of ambiguity is to write the fully qualified name of the class that we want to use:</p>
                <code class="preformat">
                    <span class="comment">//As we'll write the fully qualified names directly, we do not even need the import statement for Java.util.Date</span><br />
                    import Java.sql.*;<br />
<br />
                    public class Good {<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String... args) {<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java.util.Date date; <span class="comment"> // no more ambiguity </span><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
                    }<br />

                <p>In the above we have seen how classes are the fundamental blocks of Java as they are the blueprints of objects. We have learnt about the members of a class which are consisted of 
                both fields and methods. We now know that a field is simply a variable inside a class which is used to represent an attribute of the class. On the other hand, 
                a method is a block of code to perform something (like displaying some data, setting/updating the fields, etc.) when we call it.</p>
                <p>We have also looked at the three ways of writing comments in Java. Comments are helpful for yourself and other programmers to understand your code, especially so if it contains some complex logic.</p>
                <p>Finally, we have learnt the basics of a main() method which is the entry point of any Java program. We then look at packages and imports. While packages are useful for organizing classes and avoiding name conflicts, 
                    shall a name conflict arises when we use imports, we have seen ways how we can deal with that.
